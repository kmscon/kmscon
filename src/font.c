 * SECTION:font
 * @short_description: Font handling
 * @include: font.h
 *
 * The text renderer needs a backend that draws glyphs which then can be shown
 * on the screen. This font handling subsystem provides a very simple API to
 * load arbitrary font-renderer backends. That is, you can choose from
 * in-memory bitmap fonts up to full Unicode compatible font libraries like
 * pango during runtime.
 *
 * This system does not provide any renderer by itself. You need to register one
 * of the available font-renderers first which then is used as backend for this
 * system. kmscon_font_register() and kmscon_font_unregister() can be used to
 * register font-renderers manually.
 *
 * @kmscon_font_attr is used to specify font-attributes for the fonts you want.
 * Please see kmscon_font_find() for more information on font-attributes. This
 * function returns a matching font which then can be used for drawing.
 * kmscon_font_ref()/kmscon_font_unref() are used for reference counting.
 * kmscon_font_render() renders a single unicode glyph and returns the glyph
 * buffer. kmscon_font_drop() frees this buffer again. A kmscon_glyph object
 * contains a memory-buffer with the rendered glyph plus some metrics like
 * height/width but also ascent/descent.
 *
 * Font-backends must take into account that this API must be thread-safe as it
 * is shared between different threads to reduce memory-footprint.

/**
 * kmscon_font_find:
 * @out: A pointer to the new font is stored here
 * @attr: Attribute describing the font
 * @backend: Backend to use or NULL for default backend
 *
 * Lookup a font by the given attributes. It uses the font backend @backend. If
 * it is NULL, the default backend is used. If the given backend cannot find
 * a suitable font, the fallback backend is tried. This backend should always
 * find a suitable font.
 *
 * Stores a pointer to the new font in @out and returns 0. Otherwise, @out is
 * not touched and an error is returned.
 *
 * The attributes in @attr are not always matched. There are even font backends
 * which have only one fixed font and always return this one so you cannot rely
 * on this behavior. That is, this function cannot be used to get an exact
 * match, it rather returns the best matching font.
 * There is currently no need to get an exact match so no API is available to
 * get this. Instead, you should always use the best match and the user must be
 * happy. We do print warnings if no close match can be found, though. The user
 * should read them if they want more information what font fallback was used.
 *
 * If this functions fails, you must not assume that there is another font that
 * might work. Moreover, you must not implement a fallback font yourself as this
 * is already implemented inside of this function! This function fails only due
 * to internal errors like failed memory allocations. If it fails, the chances
 * that you can allocate your own fallback font are pretty small so don't do it.
 *
 * About DPI and Point Sizes:
 * Many computer graphics systems use "Points" as measurement for font sizes.
 * However, most of them also use 72 or 96 as fixed DPI size for monitors. This
 * means, the Point sizes can be directly converted into pixels. But lets
 * look at the facts:
 *   1 Point is defined as 1/72 of an inch. That is, a 10 Point font will be
 *   exactly 10 / 72 inches, which is ~0.13889 inches, which is
 *   0.13889 * 2.54 cm, which is approximately 0.3528 cm. This applies to
 *   printed paper. If we want the same on a monitor, we must need more
 *   information. First, the monitor renders in pixels, that is, we must know
 *   how many Pixels per Inch (PPI) are displayed. Often the same information is
 *   given as Dots per Inch (DPI) but these two are identical in this context.
 *   If the DPI is 96, we know that our 10 Point font is 10 / 72 inches. Which
 *   then means it is 10 / 72 * 96 pixels, which is ~13.333 pixels. So we
 *   internally render the font with 13 pixels and display it as 13 pixels. This
 *   guarantees, that the font will be 10 Point big which means 0.3528 cm on the
 *   display. This of course requires that we know the exact PPI/DPI of the
 *   display.
 * But if we take into account that Windows uses fixed 96 PPI and Mac OS X 72
 * PPI (independent of the monitor), they drop all this information and instead
 * render the font in pixel sizes. Because if you use fixed 72 PPI, a 10 Point
 * font will always be 10 / 72 * 72 = 10 pixels high. This means, it would be
 * rather convenient to directly specify pixel-sizes on the monitor. If you want
 * to work with documents that shall be printed, you want to specify Points so
 * the printed result will look nice. But the disadvantage is, that your monitor
 * can print this font in the weirdest size if it uses PPI much bigger or lower
 * than the common 96 or 72. Therefore, if you work with a monitor you probably
 * want to also specify the pixel-height of the font as you probably don't know
 * the PPI of your monitor and don't want to do all that math in your head.
 * Therefore, for applications that will probably never print their output (like
 * the virtual (!) console this is for), it is often requested that we can
 * specify the pixel size instead of the Point size of a font so you can
 * predict the output better.
 * Hence, we provide both. If pixel information is given, that is, attr->height
 * is not 0, then we try to return a font with this pixel height.
 * If it is 0, attr->points is used together with attr->ppi to calculate the
 * pixel size. If attr->ppi is 0, then 72 is used.
 * After the font was chosen, all fields "points", "ppi", "height" and "width"
 * will contain the exact values for this font. If "ppi" was zero and pixel
 * sizes where specified, then the resulting "points" size is calculated with
 * "ppi" = 72 again. So if you use the "points" field please always specify
 * "ppi", either.
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, error code on failure
